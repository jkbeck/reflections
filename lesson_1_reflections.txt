How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
	- It allowed me to quickly see what changed to cause the problem.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
	- It allows you to revert back several versions in case the bug was not introduced in the most recent change.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
	- Manual: 
		Pro - if done properly commits make more logical sense because they are done at the right times.
		Con - Subject to human error and forgetfulness.
	- Auto:
		Pro - will be done consistantly at regular intervals or predefined checkpoints
		Con - commits may not make as much sense because of when they are done.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
	- They each are used for different type of projects and as such have different requirements for version control.
